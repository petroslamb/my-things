I guess the girl is laughing at her brother because he's going to fall . looks like a nice house . there is a little bit of very little  but I don't think that's meant for this . the corner that got to the corner . so this is a corner here . and that goes back into there but that's  . do you see what I'm making reference to ?   the carpentry ?  \\t \\t\", \"what's happening there ?    oh my . poor kids . he's gonna  fall off that cookie jar . we'll start with the girl . she's going to receive a cookie . her brother is her brother is taking cookies out of a jar . and he got careless . and she's askin him for one . so he's handin one down to her . in the meantime he is gettin ready to fall off of the off of a stool, a three legged stool . and the mother's not payin much attention . she's lookin out the window . and in looking out the window why she's lettin her sink run over and the water's splashin on the floor all over her . and what else ?    &=noises:thinking the outside looks alright . they're doin more things on the outside . there's some more there . and then she's dryin  she's drying a dish . and she has two cups and a plate on the table . they've already eaten  . she could well I did say she was lettin the  water run over the sink down onto the floor splashing onto her feet . oh boy . then there's an angle here that is incomplete of the  t of the corner where the wall comes together . let's see what else should there be . let's see . the there's a plate two  au two cups . oh I did say she's lettin the water run over the sink didn't I ?    yes . and she  to be looking out the window while she's drying her dish . how about that ?    does that have enough ?     \\t \\t \\t\", \"oh little boy's in the cookie jar . the girl's standin down and waitin for him to give him    some give her some . the mother's doin the dishes . and she's also letting him letting     oh the water just fell off over on the floor . can I turn the page ?    okay . that's all there is except she's just gettin all wet . no . the little girl was helpin  the boy to get to the cookie jar . but he started stumblin . he must ha  fell over cause he seems to be falling there . and the mother's over at the sink drying dishes . and it's goin on the floor . and three cups three bowls there .\\t  \", \"there's a little girl  reaching for the cookie jar an she can't reach it apparently . and the the young man is helping her . he's on a stool and he's reaching for the cookie jar . an an the lady is drying dishes . an the water is pouring outta  the sink for some reason . there's some plates on the  on the counter . an she's drying a dish . I may ave said that . an the young man is going to fall off the stool . I guess maybe I said that too . and they're reachin for the cookie jar . and the an the sink is overflowing . I guess I might ave said that too . an I guess that's about  all the salient things of it. , I can see . \\t \\t\", \"here's a cookie jar . and the lid is off the cookie jar . the boy is about to come down on the floor . and the girl    I don't know that much about girls . but anyway  the housewife is in the kitchen . and the   the sink is overflowing . and the girl may be saying say  , I told you so” or something like that . and I guess this must be the wife although it might not be because maybe that was an apron and  maybe this was the     there is  this  this should be a window . there . the upper one is there . it has a pathway . we don't know where the pathway is going to because we can't see it down below . and looks like there's some flowers in the bushes or something like that . and here are some draperies . well this one in on this side is . I don't see it, the other side, but I u suspect it  it would be the same thing there . and the I guess I said that the  the water was coming down on the floor . and I don't know the    here are two cup  cup cups for coffee or something like that . and    and   \\t \\t\", \"first of all the little girl's saying  . and and he's climbing up to get a cookie . and he's going to fall . and the stool is on tipping . the water is running over in the sink . the towel seems to go in one side and out the other side of the dish . oh that's part of the curtain I guess . that's what it is . that's part of the curtain  . it looked like it gone through here and come out here  . ah . two cups and a dish . I don't see anything unusual .\\t \\t\", \"look down to talk to you ?    the little girl is saying  while the little boy is getting the cookies out o the cookie jar . he already has one and he's just getting some more . he's gonna  fall off that the  the     what do you call it ?    I can't think what you call it . the     ah !    the stool . mother is letting the water run right out o the  the  sink . she's  sink . it's a summer day or a spring day cause the window's open . what what all am I supposed to be doing ?    yeah water and cookies, the girl being quiet so the mother can't hear em . should I say that it's a  it's a summer day ?    yeah I guess it's  everything's clean outside . the trees . there's a house next door . or it it either it's part of the house or it's another house coming right next door to it . there are no handles on the  the  under part of this side of the underneath the counter . he he's standing on his own foot on this chair  . and as I say he was tipping over and the cookies   . and let's see . and as I say there aren't any knobs on the bottom to open these .  \\t \\t\", \"can I look at it and tell you ?    oh okay . well there's a girl and a boy and the boy's in the cookie jar . and he's standing on a stool that's tipping over . and he's in the kitchen . and the mother's in the kitchen running the water at the sink . and the water's running over and it's all over the floor . and there are curtains at the windows . and there are cups and a plate on the  pantry . and the the outside the window there's a path leading to a garage it looks like . and there are curtains there . and that's about all there .\\t \\t\", \"alright . I see the little boy stealing cookies from the cookie jar . and the little girl's  he gave some to the little girl and she's eatin some of the cookies . and I guess this is mama and she's washing the dishes . and she dropped a dish . no no she didn't drop a dish . the the water that she's washing the dishes with she let run . and it's overflown overflown overflown . that doesn't  that doesn't sound right . did it ?     we forgot to turn off the spigot . and so the water is running off into the onto the floor here . and mom apparently is washing the dishes . and here's this little boy stealing the cookie  cookies . he's gonna gonna  fall because his  the  the cookies jar or the  bench  s the  four legged stool whatever it is is  is gonna  fall over with him  and the cookie jar . and mama's drying the dishes as usual for mamas  if they don't have a husband that dries them or washes them or whatever . let's see now . I guess there's more things I'm supposed to see . let's see here now . oh and the the water is  flowing out of the  of the sink they forgot to turn off whoever's doing the    the dish washing . mom apparently here, she forgot to turn off the water and the  the water is spilling out over the  onto the floor onto the kitchen floor . and the little girl has pushed over the  chair   with the boy that  he that was reaching up to get the cookies . I either he she pushed it over or he fell over with it . you_know it I I excuse me but you_know I I was     \\t \\t\", \"there's a little girl . and a little boy standin on top of a stool . and it looks like a mother maybe washin the dishes in the kitchen . there's cookies in the jar up in the pantry I suppose . there's a cup two cups and a saucer or a plate maybe . there's some shrubs outside . the the sink is overflowing right now . and that's about all . the sink is overflowing . the sink is overflowing . he's tryin to kill himself  . you want more ?    that's it ?    \\t \\t \\t\", \"the boy is slipping off the stool . he's trying to steal cookie . the mother is working at the sink with the water running over . she's the little girl is  saying . the mother don't hear . did I tell say the sink was running over ?   mother's drying the dishes .

I think she is . because he is gonna  take a whole damn fall . and this girl     you gotta find something here . well the cookie jar is gonna  get smashed . if that little girl don't  . and the woman is already gettin it  from somethin . what ?    yeah she's she's in an warm water . and it's on also . and over there is cookies off the right  . yeah that's about all I can see . \\t \\t \\t\", \"go go ?    mother is washin dishes . the kids are lookin for cookies . the little girl's cryin cause he ain't givin her no cookies . and he gets the cookies down . and the mother's broke a plate . fell down . just on this page ?    that's it . she broke  broke a plate or somethin . went down the wrong way down there . just gettin the water run over . she let the water run too fast . okay .\\t \\t\", \"oh boy . wowie the boy's going up on a cookiejar  to get cookies and he's falling off the jar  and his sister is just wondering about it . will he hit the bottom ?   mama has an v a sink that's overrunning with  with  water splashin down onto her shoes . she's in the process of drying dishes . she's looking out an open window at the same time . the cookie jar is open . and the girl has her finger to her lips . well let me see . everything that's going to happen, huh ?    looking out the window maybe it I don't know if it's  the breeze blowin the curtains because the curtains look a little wee bit h over the  over the window blind over the window they look a little wee bit puffy . so maybe there's a slight breeze coming in the  in the kitchen window . mama's drying the dishes and she forgettin herself and the water is overflowing from the sink down onto the floor splashing into her shoes . alright there are two cups and a plate on the counter to the right of the sink . and  the boy well I did tell you the boy is gettin ready to fall off of the chair   . his sister is reaching up for a cookie, gettin it from the cookie jar . so what else ?    the the door is open of course to get into the cupboard . doin . three three legged stool . I would venture to say that is it . \\t \\t\", \"you want me to tell you ?    the girl is talking to the boy . he's getting the cookie jar down . he has a &coo cookie in his hand . he's falling off of his stool . the mother's doing the dishes and the water's running off into the floor  . she's looking out the window apparently .

I thought there was something around the little boy's foot or at least  at least just one part of one foot  foot  on top of the other . the little girl I I don't whether she's laughing or asking for the cookie or saying “shh” so mother doesn't hear them  .  \\t \\t\", \"well the girl is telling the boy to get the cookies down but don't tell your mother . and the boy is also falling over off the stool . and the mother is letting the water run out of the sink . and she's dryin dishes . I don't quite get that but then      she has water on the floor and  and basically it's kind_of  a distressing scene . everything's goin haywire . she needs to turn off the water . if she turned off the water she'd be a hundred percent better off . \\t \\t \\t\", \"well this here is cookie jar . looks like the the boy's pickin up a bunch or something . he's fallin off the chair  down here or tryin to . here and down hiss  . she been washin the dishes . she was she left with the dish for  maybe . and this is is that possible ?    that's a door . or this is a    yeah this  water's runnin off of there . this  this thing here .
